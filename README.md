Stock price prediction is the task of forecasting the future value of a stock based on historical data and other relevant factors. Machine learning has become an increasingly popular approach to predicting stock prices, as it can analyze large amounts of data and identify complex patterns that may not be immediately apparent to humans.

There are several machine learning techniques that can be used for stock price prediction, including regression analysis, time series analysis, and neural networks. Regression analysis involves fitting a mathematical model to historical data and using it to make predictions about future stock prices.

Predicting the closing price of a particular stock listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) is a common application of machine learning in finance. The closing price is the final price at which a stock is traded on a given day, and predicting it accurately can help investors make informed trading decisions.
